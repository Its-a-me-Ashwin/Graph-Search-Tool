Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. ... For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.
