Uniform-Cost Search is a variant of Dijikstraâ€™s algorithm. Here, instead of inserting all vertices into a priority queue, we insert only source, then one by one insert when needed. In every step, we check if the item is already in priority queue (using visited array). If yes, we perform decrease key, else we insert it.
This variant of Dijsktra is useful for infinite graphs and those graph which are too large to represent in the memory. Uniform-Cost Search is mainly used in Artificial Intelligence.
